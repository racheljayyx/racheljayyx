# My Project

## Introduction

This is a simple example of a README file written in Markdown with HTML.

## Colored Boxes

You can add colored boxes using HTML:

<div style="background-color:#ffdddd;padding:10px;border-radius:5px;">
  This is a red box.
</div>

<div style="background-color:#ddffdd;border:1px solid #009900;padding:10px;border-radius:5px;">
  This is a green box with a border.
</div>
